            <h2>A Happy Map</h2>
            <p>In order to measure happiness, it is important to understand the different types of attributes that are associated with it. In our dataset, we look at the life expectancy, gross domestic product (GDP), social support, the freedom to make life choices, generosity and the level of corruption in a country. Each of these attributes are scaled into an index to produce a score representing the level of happiness in a country. In this analysis we look at countries in 2019 and see how they performed. From our map we can see the highest scoring country Finland, with a score of 7.77 and the lowest performing being South Sudan, with a score of 0.31 in happiness.</p>

            <h2>Health and Happiness</h2>
            <p>It is hard to argue that without good health one can be happy, however it seems that some countries have a fine-tuned balance. Countries like Singapore and Japan have some of the highest life expectancies in the world with an average happiness score around 6. We can see there is a high amount of European and Central Asian countries dominating the both attributes, while Sub-Saharan African countries have some of both the lowest life expectancies and happiness scores as well. Countries with strong social support systems often provide better health services, and we can see that linear relationship from the improving life expectancies of countries. </p>

            <h2>Wealth and Happiness</h2>
            <p>As seen in our previous graph, the regions with on average the highest life expectancy, social support and happiness are those in Europe/Central Asia and North America and parts of East Asia/Pacific. Often advances in health and social support are in direct relation to the wealth of a country, a measure we can analyse from a countries GDP. Much like our health measures, we see the same dominance in regions and follow a similar trend. However, it is important to note that East Asia/Pacific GDP is heavily boosted by China why North America by United Sates, the largest economies in the world.</p>

            <h2>Education and Happiness</h2>
            <p>Like wealth, highly advance economies are in correlation to the level of education within their population. A good measure of this is looking at how much of the population undertake tertiary studies, as higher education beyond secondary school often leads to higher paying jobs. Looking at the number of enrolments we see that East Asia/Pacific has the highest number of enrolments in the last ten years. Like East Asia/Pacific, South Asia also has increasing numbers in enrolments, but this may be associated with the large populations of China and India respectively. The important aspect to analyse is the rate of enrolment rather than the numbers, and here we see that Europe/Central Asia and North America have declining rates of enrolment, even though they have some of the highest scores of happiness.</p>

            <h2>Security and Happiness</h2>
            <p>One attribute which cannot be ignored in calculating a countries happiness is how safe one feels in it. In the chart below, we see a measure of the unrest in a country, the freedom of choice and the level of perceived corruption. As expected, there are many countries with high happiness that also exhibit high safety. However, it is interesting to see the spread of some countries in Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa with their freedom to make choices. Even though some of these countries donâ€™t have high safety, there are some that still have a relatively high score of happiness compared to others near them in the chart.</p>
